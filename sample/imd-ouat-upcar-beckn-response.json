The following recommendations are made: - In order to conserve the environment and nutrients, farmers should never burn the crop residue after harvesting wheat but should increase the fertility of the soil by decomposing it in the field. To decompose the wheat residue, apply cow dung manure at the rate of 5 tonnes / ha on a priority basis. If cow dung manure is not available, it is 20 kg. /. Additional nitrogen or 2.5 kg. Mix Trichoderma birdii with soil or sand and put it in the field before ploughing. Deep ploughing of the field in summer. Get a soil test done and use fertilizers only as recommended. In rice-planting areas, sow henna or hancha for hati compost as early as possible. Paddy seeds are available at the Agriculture Department godowns in all the districts. For protection against soil-borne diseases like stem rot, root rot, scorch, brown spot, acne, bacterial scorch, yeast, etc., Trichordia baviridi is sold at 4% WP or Trichordaria 2% WP for 2.5 kg. It is per. 65-75 kg. Preventing diseases like sheath blight, false bollworm, etc. can be done by spraying light water mixed with rotten cow dung manure and keeping it in shade for 8-40 days and then adding it to the soil at the last ploughing before sowing. Vuberia baesiana for protection against termites, white girders, nematodes, root rot, cutworms, etc. 2.5 kg of Percentage W, P. kg from 65-75 at the rate of / he. After spraying light water mixed with cow dung manure and keeping it in shade for 8 to 40 days, the land should be treated by mixing it in the fields at the time of last ploughing. Continue to irrigate urad, moong, and sugarcane crops and lychee and mango orchards as needed to retain sufficient moisture. Ensure seeding for long duration varieties of paddy from 20th May."
