To decompose the wheat residue, apply cow dung manure at the rate of 5 tonnes / ha on a priority basis. If cow dung manure is not available, it is 20 kg. /. Additional nitrogen or 2.5 kg. Mix Trichoderma birdii with soil or sand and put it in the field before ploughing. Deep ploughing of the field in summer. Get a soil test done and use fertilizers only as recommended. In rice-planting areas, sow henna or hancha for hati compost as early as possible. Paddy seeds are available at the Agriculture Department godowns in all the districts. For protection against soil-borne diseases like stem rot, root rot, scorch, brown spot, acne, bacterial scorch, yeast, etc., Trichordia baviridi is sold at 4% WP or Trichordaria 2% WP for 2.5 kg.
