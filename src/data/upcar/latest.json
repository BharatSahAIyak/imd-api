   "general_advisory": "Excessive temperature and humidity in the environment will lead to diseases and pests in crops, so use eco-friendly pest control measures such as photosynthesis, bird percher, pheromone traps, trichogramma, and trichoderma for disease control. Maintain sufficient moisture for proper plant growth in areas of low rainfall, especially in the case of paddy stubble and wheat formation, so that cracks do not form in the soil. Vegetable growers in areas that have not received adequate rainfall are advised to grow spinach, radish, carrot, turnip, beetroot, fenugreek, coriander, etc. for good yield even in short duration and less water. Natural and organic farming should be promoted, agrochemicals should be used on scientific advice only as recommended. Give intravenous and external anti-parasitic drugs to animals on the advice of a veterinarian. Early potato sowing will start from 45th September, so remove the potato from the cold storage and treat it.",
